DESCRIPTION:

A "simple" antivirus scanner that supports updates over the Internet. 

The antivirus contains a list of known harmless programs - a whitelist - and a known malware
signature list - a blacklist - and detects malware based on signatures of malicious programs. 

Any detected malicious program is quarantined by removing its permissions and appending a ".virus"
suffix to the name. User is appropriately notified of this via an alert message box.

The antivirus runs in two scanning modes:

        i) On Demand Scanning:
           In On Demand scanning, the user can run a program to scan a file, or a directory
           containing files, e.g. antivirus-scan /home/jack/Downloads.

        ii) On Access Scanning:
           In On Access scanning, in order to protect the user, a kernel driver hooks into the
           appropriate system calls (e.g. open, execl, execlp, execle, execv, execvp, execvpe) and
           scans the file before it is opened. If the file is a virus, then the antivirus
           refuses to open the file.

Details of usage can be found in the "INSTRUCTIONS" section.

DESIGN DECISIONS:

In this section, we describe the various design decisions that we undertook for the project.

Database APIs and Tables:

The application uses a mysql DB to store the values of the whitelisted hashes and the blacklisted 
virus signatures. There are two separate tables, one table (whitelist) used for storing the hashes 
of whitelisted applications, One table(blacklist) used for storing the blacklist signatures. 

whitelist table:
1. hash_id 	- integer primary key.
2. hash 	- varchar 65 characters long string.

blacklist table:
1. signature_id	- integer primary key.
2. signature	- varible length signature having max 65535 characters long.

The DB modules consists of three API calls, one API call for checking whether a hash value exists 
in database, one for retrieving a list of all the blacklist signatures, last one for getting 
updates from remote server. 

API Calls:

1. struct signatures* getstructures()
	This call returns a concatenated string of all the blacklisted virus signatures delimited 
	by a '\0' along  with the number of such strings. This method return NULL on error and 
	valid struct object on success.

2. int update_structures()
	This call removes existing values in both the tables, connects to a remote database gets 
	the new values and inserts them into the local database. The entire operation is performed
	as a single transaction. In case of failure, the db will still be in a stable state.
	This method return -1 on error, and 0 on success.

3. int isWhitelisted(char * file_path)
	This method gets the file location as input, calculates the sha256 hash value of the file,
	checks to see if the value already exists in the database returns 1 if the hash exists, 
	0 if the hash doesn't exist and -1 on error.

The remote server is a mysql DB server, which allows remote connection to user based on the 
permissions granted to the user. The entire operation of update is performed as a single 
transaction, in case anything breaks in between, the entire transaction is rolled back and the
database always remains in a stable state.

The hash function used in our application is SHA256, which gives a 32 byte hash value for each
hashed file.

Antivirus Userspace executable:

For the antivirus userspace application, we store the list of files that have been flagged as mali-
cious programs within a linked list where each list entry contains path to the malicious file.

This list is used to show to the user the files that have been quarantined - displayed via xmessage
that displays it in a message box.

we decided to add recursive traversal of subdirectories and files so as to scan all the contents
within a directory.
So, to keep track of the current directory namespace, we maintain a stack that stores the index,
within the namespace, the location where the next directory name/file names needs to be added to

The antivirus also supports scanning on softlinks - if a linked file is detected as a virus, its
permissions are removed but the link to it is renamed with a ".virus" added at the end of the link
name.

For updating the virus database definitions, the antivirus makes use of the updateStructures()
described above.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Our antivirus works with *nix machines.

We have provided a Makefile that can be used to build our antivirus as follows:

        i) Download the source from <link>

        ii) Extract the source files and use the following commands:
                
                make - To compile all the antivirus source code

                make clean - clean up

The antivirus can run in two modes (described in the "DESCRIPTION" section) - On Demand and On Access

        i) For On Demand scanning of files or to update the antivirus definitions from remote repo:

                ./antivirus (-u|path to file/directory)

                Description of arguments:
                -u                      - Update database definitions
                path to file/directory  - Path of file/directory to scan

        ii) For On Access scanning,

                <Fill in the details>

The antivirus uses a MySQL DB backend to store virus definitions that are used in scans. So, MySQL
should be installed on the user machine for the antivirus software to be fully effective.

MySQL installation guide can be found at:
        https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-14-04

In order to update virus definitions, we had to add firewall whitelisting and grant privileges on
the remote MySQL DB as follows:

/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i <interface> -p tcp --destination-port 3306 -j ACCEPT

grant all privileges on "database.tables" to 'username'@'%' identified by 'passphrase'
